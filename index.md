I am a **postdoctoral fellow** at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, supervised by Dr. [Jian Zhou](https://zhoulab.io/thepi). I completed my Ph. D. in [Mathematics](https://math.columbian.gwu.edu/) from The George Washington University (GWU) under the mentorship of Dr. [Max Alekseyev](https://home.gwu.edu/~maxal/). In the past, I worked at the [Computational Biology Institute, GWU](https://cbi.gwu.edu), [National Institution of Health](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/), and Illumina Inc.

My current research interest lies in the development of new mathematical theories and algorithmic solutions for emerging problems in biology. I also believe that attempts to build a rigorous theory in the field of biology provide a strong motivation for formulating new fascinating problems in mathematics and computer science. You can check a [list of published papers](/publications) and a [list of completed projects](/software) that I was involved in the past years.
